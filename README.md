# pce-preliminary-design-report

This report was written as the senior project for my BS in environmental engineering. My team of eight members worked with our client on a real remediation project concerning a pce contamination. We collected data, created models, and conducted much research. At the end of the project, we recommended a remediation plan to our client.
